# Walmart Sales Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales for 45 Walmart stores across different regions in the US. Walmart often runs into issues with unforeseen demand, leading to stockouts, especially during major holidays and promotional markdowns. The goal is to develop regression models to predict sales while considering various factors like holidays, economic conditions, and markdown events.

## Problem Statement
Walmart needs a robust machine learning model to accurately predict sales and demand, reducing stockouts and maximizing revenue. This project aims to:
- Analyze and clean the sales dataset.
- Build and compare regression models for predicting sales based on both single and multiple features.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like R², RMSE, etc.

## Data Description
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Stores:** 45 Walmart stores in different regions.
- **Features:**
  - Sales data over time
  - Economic indicators (CPI, Unemployment Index)
  - Markdown events
  - Holiday effects (Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas)

## Objective
1. Clean and preprocess the dataset.
2. Build regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, etc.) for predicting sales.
3. Evaluate model performance using metrics like R², RMSE.
4. Address the effects of markdowns and holidays in the sales prediction models.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**

## Results and Insights
The models will be compared based on their prediction accuracy, focusing on how well they handle the holiday periods and markdown events. The final report will include insights on key features impacting sales and suggestions for improving demand forecasting.
